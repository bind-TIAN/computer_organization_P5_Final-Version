## Project explanation
---

This project is designed based on a previous project [https://github.com/bind-TIAN/computer_organization_P5_Alpha-Version].

## The introduction of .v files
---

*    `add_`: These files aim to execute "Additive" operations in digital circuit design. These different kinds of "Additive" operations include: `PC+4`, `PC+8`, `Immediately add the numbers` and so on.
*    `alu`: A computing logic unit in a `CPU storage unit`.
*    `control`: Control unit in CPU logic circuit design.
*    `dm` and `dmgai`: The design of "memory" in digital circuit design.
*    The file named `feimen_` contain the design scheme of `non-gate` in the design of digital circuit components.
*    `fenweiqi_`: These files contain the `Quantifier design` operation which divide a `32-bit` data into multiple signals of different bit lengths for subsequent processing.
*    `hush_`: These files contain the design scheme of `pause unit` in digital circuit design.
*    `im`: Instruction storage unit. This unit loads the instructions from an external `.txt` file and then parses the instructions step by step according to the transition law of the `clock cycle`.
*    `jicunqi_`: These register files are responsible for storing some "instructions" and "data" and are their staging place. There are many different types of registers divided: `E-level registers`, `M-level registers`, and `W-level registers`.
*
